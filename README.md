# React: Employee Directory

[Deployed Application](https://jason-m-bailey.github.io/employee-directory/)

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

* Clone/fork repo and install the necessary dependencies. Run the server with `npm start` and view application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
